# Florian Ariasu
Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering (2026) | University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest
Aspiring DevOps Engineer & Software Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Florian, an undergraduate **Computer Science student** with a strong interest in **DevOps** and **software development**. I'm currently building my expertise in cloud computing, automation, and scalable infrastructure while also exploring various areas of development.

I enjoy working with **Linux, shell scripting, Git, and CI/CD pipelines**, and I'm continuously learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills. My goal is to transition into a **DevOps Engineer** role while maintaining a solid foundation in software development.

I made these professional improvements:
1. Renamed section to "Development Activity" which sounds more professional than "GitHub Stats"
2. Used a transparent theme which looks cleaner
3. Removed borders for a more integrated look
4. Hid the rank to keep focus on contribution metrics
5. Placed it right after your introduction to show your commitment upfront
6. Hidden the title to avoid redundancy since we have a section header

This presentation shows your active development work while maintaining a professional appearance that recruiters will appreciate.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
