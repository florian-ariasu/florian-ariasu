# Florian AriaÈ™u
Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering (2026) | University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest
Aspiring DevOps Engineer & Software Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Florian, an undergraduate **Computer Science student** with a strong interest in **DevOps** and **software development**. I'm currently building my expertise in cloud computing, automation, and scalable infrastructure while also exploring various areas of development.

I enjoy working with **Linux, shell scripting, Git, and CI/CD pipelines**, and I'm continuously learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills. My goal is to transition into a **DevOps Engineer** role while maintaining a solid foundation in software development.
