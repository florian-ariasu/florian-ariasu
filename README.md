## Relevant Projects

### [Dental Caries Detection](https://github.com/florian-ariasu/dental-caries-cascade)
*A two-stage cascade system for dental caries detection in panoramic radiographs, combining YOLOv8 localization with ResNet50 patch verification to improve diagnostic precision.*

- Engineered a hybrid decision pipeline to suppress false positives caused by radiological artefacts and metallic restorations.
- Coordinated the processing of over 18,000 dental image patches, producing a robust training environment for early-stage lesion detection.
- Conducted a structured comparative evaluation between the baseline and cascade system, documenting methodological limitations in a final IEEE-format report.

`Python` `YOLOv8` `ResNet50`

### [Air Traffic Control System](https://github.com/florian-ariasu/air-traffic-control-system)
*An object-oriented Java ATC system with generic runways, priority-based flight scheduling, and custom exceptions for takeoff and landing management, built using Gradle.*

- Designed and implemented a custom exception hierarchy to handle critical runtime scenarios, including unavailable runways and allocation conflicts.
- Leveraged Java Generics to ensure codebase scalability and reuse across heterogeneous aircraft types.

`Java` `Gradle`

### [OpenBook — Open-Source E-Reader](https://github.com/florian-ariasu/ebook-reader)
*An open-source hardware project for building a portable, ESP32-C6–based e-book reader with an E-Paper display, microSD storage, USB-C power/data, and Li-Po battery support.*

- Configured the ESP32-C6 pinout and integrated environmental sensors over the I²C bus.
- Managed the PCB routing phase, manually validating design rule violations to ensure physical device integrity.

`ESP32-C6` `Autodesk Fusion 360` `E-Paper Display`

### [Algorithm Optimisation Suite](https://github.com/florian-ariasu/algorithm-optimisation-suite)
*A collection of algorithmic solutions covering binary search, dynamic programming, greedy optimisation, and sequence processing, each tailored for efficient problem-solving.*

- Quantitatively compared IDA\* and Simulated Annealing across metrics including expanded states and runtime.
- Implemented Dynamic Programming and Greedy strategies for resource efficiency maximization.

`Python` `C++`
