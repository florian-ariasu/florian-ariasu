## Professional Overview  

I'm Florian, an undergraduate Computer Science student with a strong interest in DevOps and software development. I'm currently building expertise in cloud computing, automation, and scalable infrastructure while exploring various areas of development.

I enjoy working with Linux, shell scripting, Git, and CI/CD pipelines, and I’m continuously learning new tools and technologies to enhance my skills. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in both DevOps and software development, with a focus on leveraging automation, scalability, and efficient development practices.
