## Professional Overview  

I am Florian, an undergraduate Computer Science student specialising in DevOps practices and software development. My focus areas include cloud computing, automation, and scalable infrastructure from an operational and architectural perspective.

I work extensively with Linux environments, Git-based version control, and shell scripting (Bash/Zsh). Having implemented automation workflows with GitHub Actions, I am actively expanding my expertise in CI/CD practices. My goal is to develop a deep understanding of DevOps and software engineering, with a strong emphasis on automation, infrastructure scalability, and efficient development workflows.
